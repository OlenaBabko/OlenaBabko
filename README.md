### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and SQL.
And I also dive a little into cloud technologies thanks to Google Cloud Skills Boost.
With these skills, I want to start my journey as a Data Analyst or Data Engineer. Maybe one day I will become a real Data Scientist ðŸ¤ž
I am interested in AR/VR, Blockchain, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and so on!
